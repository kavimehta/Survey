	<h1>What is my Score and how does it get calculated?</h1>
	<p>Your score is a measure of your emotional wellbeing on the given day, with 100 being the highest possible score and 0 being the lowest possible score. In the survey, each positive emotion receives a value from 0 (for "Not at all") to 5 (for "Very"), and each negative emotion receives a value from 5 to 0 in the same way. The values of the ten emotions are summed and doubled to give the final score.</p>
