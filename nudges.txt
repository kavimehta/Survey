DAY 1 Low 0-42

Look on the bright side.
------------------------

Pollyanna was the title character of a best-selling 1913 children’s book of the same name. After her father taught her to play “The Glad Game” she became impossibly optimistic, always seeking the upside of the gloomiest situation.

For example, expecting to pull a doll from a lucky dip but finding instead a pair of crutches, Pollyanna’s father told her to look on the bright side because, “We didn’t need to use them!”

Although modern-day Pollyannas are derided for being unrealistic, I’d actually encourage you to adopt her mindset today to help change the way you view a current problem.

Begin by making up a “Pollyanna” view of the problem that’s as ridiculous as possible. By all means laugh at yourself. But then gradually turn down the optimism control until you reach a point that’s just about realistic and almost certainly more positive than your current one.

Tweaking the story is a great way to bounce back.

* What’s one current problem that’s getting you down? E.g. I’m afraid my low mood is going to make it impossible to go to work.

* What would be a ridiculously optimistic way to view this issue? E.g. Great! I’ll hand in my notice and go live by the ocean!

* How could this “Pollyanna” view reframe your problem? E.g. Maybe I should ask my boss for a couple of days off to rest and recover.

DAY 1 Medium 43-67 

Phone a friend.
---------------

When you have a bad spell it’s common to believe it’s always been this way, so don’t despair if that’s how you feel right now. It’s a normal human reaction.

A helpful way of bouncing back is to recall previous mood-beating achievements, trying to recall what you did right in the past. That might not be easy, so your mission today is to enlist the help of a friend or family member who was around when you successfully fought back from a previous low.

Our minds sometimes protect us from past pain by blotting out unpleasant memories, so it could be that you can’t even really remember what you did that helped.

And that’s where others can lend a hand.

Reach out to someone whose memories might be more complete than your own.

Ask them to help you work out what made a difference, then plan to do the same kinds of things again soon.

* Who has seen you recover from a low mood in the past?

* How and when can you contact them? E.g. By email this morning, in person tonight.

* (Later.) What “bouncing back” strategies did they help you recall?

DAY 1 High 68-100

Who’s got you covered?
----------------------

Department stores sell few umbrellas on sunny days. When the weather’s fine, people rarely plan for when it won’t be.

In fact the same is often also true of our “emotional weather”. If you’re like me you probably don’t think much about dealing with gloomy days when, for once, you’re going through a better patch.

It’s okay, it’s human nature. But you know what? Right now, when things are better, it makes a lot of sense to invest in some contingency planning.

A useful way to bounce back from bad times is making sure you have one or two people you can count on, and I expect you know who they are.

I’m sure they’ll do this unreservedly, probably as you would do for them if they needed support. But they’re important to you, so why not reach out to them today?

Perhaps you have no need for their help right now, but you may in the future. And it’s always easier to ask for support from someone who’s known you in good times as well as bad.

* Which one person has been there for you in the past, and probably will be again in the future?

* How will you get in touch with them? E.g. Email, phone calls, visit, greeting card

* When can you schedule this?

DAY 2 Low 0-42

Unlock your cage.
-----------------

Happily most zoos have changed, so it’s rightly rare to find an animal kept in inhumane conditions these days.

But it wasn’t always this way of course. Zoos of the past squeezed their animals into tiny cages, subjecting them to day-in, day-out routines that left them bored and hopeless. Just as you probably do, I shudder to think of it.

Oddly though, we humans sometimes incarcerate ourselves in imaginary cages of our own making, particularly when we feel low. Not surprisingly this makes us feel even worse.

By doing the same old thing in the same old way, day after day, we “cage ourselves,” not even varying our surroundings. Please don’t let that happen to you.

Today’s a good day to shake things up just a little. Maybe you don’t really feel like it, so tread lightly, but try to gently change some routines in the next 24 hours.

* What do you do in the same way almost every day? E.g. Always have the same thing for breakfast and eat it in the same place

* How could you change the way you do this one thing? E.g. Have fresh fruit instead of toast, take my breakfast into another room or the garden

* (Later.) What was it like when you tried that?

DAY 2 Medium 43-67

No more bananas.
----------------

The term “comfort zone” has been in common use since the 1990s, but the idea of behaving in a way that minimizes stress and risk isn’t exactly new.

Of course there are times when staying in your comfort zone makes sense. For example it probably stops you straying down dangerous dark alleys on the wrong side of town.

Sometimes, however, stepping out of your comfort zone can mean the difference between a so-so day and a truly memorable one. So let me recommend shaking up tried-and-tested routines a bit today.

A slightly unconventional way to pull this off is to take the last letter of the word that describes whatever you usually do, then decide to do something which begins with that letter instead.

Always eat a bananA for breakfast? Try an Apricot. Generally watch the newS on TV? Why not try a Sitcom? While it’s sensible not to disrupt behaviors you find genuinely comforting, it can be rewarding to introduce a little novelty now and then.

* Which word describes a routine you could change? E.g. Phone calL, SandwicH

* Think of a new word that begins with the behavior’s last letter. E.g. Letter, Hotdog

* What can you do now to remind yourself to tackle things differently today? E.g. Take out my writing paper, place a reminder in my wallet for lunchtime

DAY 2 High 68-100

Cheese?
-------

In 1908 the psychologists Yerkes and Dodson explained that we perform better when our stress levels are slightly higher than normal.

They called this “Optimal Anxiety”, suggesting that although too much stress is bad, just enough anxiety can be good for you. How could you make use of this? Try stepping out of your comfort zone today. Not too far, but just enough to make you very slightly apprehensive. Maybe you feel strong enough right now to try something a little different, so here are three suggestions. How about pulling on an item of clothing you wouldn’t usually wear? Why not visit somewhere you’ve never been before (an art gallery, a cheese shop)? Or take a completely new route and perhaps a different mode of transport for a journey you make every day? Mix it up.

Do something that makes you feel just a little jittery.

* What regular routine can you change in the next day?

* How will you approach it differently?

* In order to ensure you pull this off, what plans might you need to make?

DAY 3 Low 0-42

Take time out from tech.
------------------------

In theory, technology should provide the ideal way to stay in touch with the world when your spirits are low. In theory. The reality is that when we feel a bit below par, most of us tend to shy away from tech-initiated contacts just as much as we do face-to-face connections.

Do you recognize this in yourself? The most you may do is check email and social media, but you could find yourself doing so incessantly. In fact, people suffering from low mood can end up feeling even worse because of social comparisons online: the “Everyone on Facebook is Having a Great Time, Except Me” syndrome.

If you’re not feeling great, by all means pick up the phone to talk to a friend, or text them. But rather than waste hours becoming disillusioned on Facebook, why not take a healthy break from technology instead? Turn off the computer and TV, and go for a walk or curl up with a good book.

Of course, taking a tech break won’t solve all your problems, but at the very least it might stop you from feeling worse. And at best you might even enjoy it.

* Have you noticed yourself getting over-attached to technology, and if so, when? E.g. Repetitively checking Facebook while also watching TV

* When could you take a break from technology? E.g. During the early evening, after dinner

* What could you do to replace this? E.g. Go for a walk around the block

DAY 3 Medium 43-67

Turn off.
---------

One advantage of technology is that it can make you feel like you’re never out of touch. If you need something or someone, it or they are only a button click away.

Unfortunately this state of constant connectivity can also leave you worrying that you’d miss something if you were without your electronic devices.

Perhaps instinctively you know that too much tech isn’t good for you, but “FOMO” (Fear Of Missing Out) stops you from pushing the Off button.

I wouldn’t mind betting though, that you do already turn your back on technology every night when you go to sleep. Then when you wake up six or seven hours later, guess what? That’s right, the Internet is still there.

Sometime in the next 24 hours, therefore, I’d like to recommend that you unplug a little. Replace your use of technology with something that is better for you, even if only for a while.

* When’s a good moment to switch off electronic devices? E.g. On my commute, two hours before bedtime

* What will you do instead? E.g. Tackle a crossword puzzle*, read a book

* (Later.) How did that feel? Will you do it again?

*Er, not if your commute involves driving, of course.

DAY 3 High 68-100

Don’t shut yourself away.
-------------------------

Imagine taking a dream vacation to somewhere you’ve always wanted to visit.

Everything’s perfect.

The weather is superb. The hotel is magnificent. The location is even better than you’d dared hope.

So what do you do then? Well for some unknown reason, you spend the entire trip cooped up alone in your hotel room.

It makes no sense, does it? But this is not that different from feeling pretty good, as you do right now, only to bury yourself in electronic media.

There’s a big, bright world out there waiting to be enjoyed, so why not take a complete break from technology today? Perhaps not for the whole day, but certainly make your break long enough to appreciate the calm stillness.

You may need to let others know so they don’t worry about your electronic absence, but you’ll almost certainly enjoy it.

* When will you give yourself some time without technology?

* What enjoyable activity can you plan instead?

* Are you concerned about being without technology for a while? If so, record your worries below. Then forget them. I think you’ll be fine.

DAY 4

DAY 4 Low 0-42

Spell it out.
-------------

If you feel low, it’s not unusual to feel uncared-for and unsupported.

Of course you’re almost certainly viewing life through a distorting lens, but even though there are sure to be people who care about you and want to support you, it’s common to feel abandoned when you’re down.

Curiously, the best time to offer kindness to others is just when you feel you’re receiving little yourself. You see, research suggests that we may actually get more out of helping other people than they do out of being helped.

Unfortunately it’s hard to motivate yourself to behave kindly in a world that seems cruel. Maybe you could think of it as a kind of medication, though, and accept that—even when you know it’s good for you—medicine often tastes bitter.

So look for opportunities to be kind to others today. Why not specifically make a point of thanking someone you notice doing a good job?

Set out to be kind today and - who knows? — maybe the world will return the compliment.

* Where might you encounter someone doing a good job today? E.g. On my way to work, at the grocery store

* What’s the smallest way in which you could pass on your thanks? E.g. Simply saying “thanks for doing a good job” or even more simply, smiling.

* How would you feel if someone praised you in the same way?

DAY 4 Medium 43-67

Make your own morphine.
-----------------------

If you’re like most people, I can’t imagine you keep a supply of morphine and heroin in your medicine cabinet.

But even if you’d never dream of experimenting with narcotics, scientists suggest you may have already experienced a similar effect—through the simple act of helping someone else.

Altruistic behavior is known to raise the brain’s own form of morphine- and heroin-like biochemicals, known as “endogenous opioids”, producing a happy rush often referred to as the “helper’s high”.

However, don’t simply take my word for it, try it for yourself. Why not plan a kindness day for the next 24 hours?

Taking part is simple. Just look for three opportunities to do nice things for people. Let someone go in front of you. Give someone a hug. Hold the door open.

Simple things. Big impact.

* How could you plan to do your three kind things? E.g. One on my journey to work, one at lunchtime, and another on the way home

* On a scale of 0 to 5, how determined are you to do this?

* (Later.) What, briefly, were the three kind things you did?

DAY 4 High 68-100

Be kind.
--------

Feeling good can be contagious. When your mood is positive you’re likely to “infect” other people. But even better, there’s a way to “share the love” which may actually benefit you even more than those to whom you pass it on.

So what is it? Just be kind to people, and almost certainly you’ll find no shortage of opportunities to help others in this way today.

In fact the Dalai Lama says: “Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.”

Here’s an idea then.

As you go about your business today, imagine the Dalai Lama at your side, dressed in gold and maroon.

With every person you encounter, how might he suggest you react? What kindness would he encourage you to offer?

How much good could you do in one single day?

* How can you remind yourself to channel your own inner Dalai Lama?

* What do you think the Dalai Lama would say about your experiment?

* (Later.) How did it feel to be kind to people?

DAY 5 Low 0-42

Photographic memories.
----------------------

I’m sure we’ve both experienced that thing when you feel less shiny than usual and don’t particularly want much to do with anyone.

This kind of “retreating to your cave” behavior is actually pretty common when people feel low, so neither of us should feel we’re that unusual.

But maybe you know that your social connections play an important part in how you feel, so you end up in a kind of Catch-22 situation. You recognize that connecting would probably help you feel better, but you don’t want to connect because you feel bad.

But wait, there’s good news, because researchers agree that the benefits of connection are actually linked to your subjective view of your relationships with others. So you may be able to “trick” your brain into feeling more connected without even picking up the phone.

One way to do that? Just take several minutes to look at photos of those closest to you. Gaze at them fondly, focusing on your warm connection. Try it. It can really work.

* Which people do you wish you were more connected to right now?

* Where can you find photos of them?

* When can you spend five minutes looking at these pictures in real depth?

DAY 5 Medium 43-67

Love the ones you’re with.
--------------------------

Based on the fact that social connections play an important part in whether we feel good or not, you might think supermarket clerks should be the happiest people in the world.

Just imagine how many people they must come into contact with every day.

So why do so many checkout operators look glum? Of course the truth is that it’s not the quantity of connections you experience that counts, but their quality.

And the relationships that contribute most to your well-being are those that are close, secure and supportive. Fortunately you can boost the strength of these important connections whenever you wish, simply by nurturing your close relationships.

Today’s a great day to do this. Someone somewhere will benefit from knowing you’re thinking of them and caring about them. Let them know, and you’ll feel closer.

A good feeling to have.

* Who might need reminding that you care about them?

* How can you get in touch with them? E.g. Make a phone call, send an email or text, write a letter

* When will you do this?

DAY 5 High 68-100

Tell them why they rock your world.
-----------------------------------

Here’s a quiz question.

Which one of these four health conditions do you think poses the most risk? High blood pressure, lack of social connections, obesity, or smoking?

Remarkably, it’s the second of these. Feeling lonely and unloved is a greater health threat than high blood pressure, obesity and smoking.

Right now you may feel relatively well-connected to others, but knowing how important it is to your future health, there’s probably no better way to invest in your well-being than to spend a little time nurturing your relationships with those closest to you.

One simple but powerful way to do so is to tell them exactly why you care so much. Even if they look embarrassed, deep down they’ll love to hear it.

* Who will you remind that you care about them?

* What’s the best way to do this? Clue: how would they do this if the shoe was on the other foot?

* When will you tell them?
